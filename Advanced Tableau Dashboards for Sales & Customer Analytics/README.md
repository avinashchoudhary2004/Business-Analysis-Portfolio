# Advanced Tableau Dashboards for Sales & Customer Analytics

## Project Background
This project was designed to develop **advanced Tableau dashboards** to help executives, sales managers, and marketing teams analyze sales performance and customer behaviors.  

The dashboards provide an interactive, year-over-year comparison of KPIs, uncover trends in revenue and profit, and identify top-performing category and customers. 

Insights and recommendations are provided through dashboards for the latest year, with comparisons from previous year across the following key areas:
* **Sales Trends Analysis** – Revenue and profit growth, weekly trends, and regional comparisons.  
* **Category Level Performance** – Category-level profitability and loss-making subcategories.  
* **Customer Analytics** – Customer growth, order distribution, and contribution to overall sales.

## Data Structure & Initial Checks
The analysis was conducted using the data model represented in the following ERD diagram:

Prior to analysis, checks were conducted for duplicates, missing values, and relational integrity across joins to ensure accuracy.

## Executive Summary
**Overview of Findings:**  
The company delivered strong performance with 27.9% year-over-year sales growth to $965K and a 32% increase in profit to $103K. Growth was fueled by leading product categories such as Phones and Chairs (each contributing $148K in sales) and by profit drivers like Phones and Copiers, which together accounted for nearly half of total profitability.

Despite these gains, customer growth remained stagnant at just 0.5% YoY, and over the past five years the customer base has expanded by only 30%. This highlights persistent acquisition challenges and increasing reliance on existing customers to sustain growth.

## Insights Deep Dive

### Sales Trends
* **+27.9% YoY Growth:** Total sales grew to **$965K in the current year**, compared to the previous year, with profits up **+32% ($103K)**.    
* **Weekly Averages:** Weekly sales averaged **$18.2K** (up from **$14.2K** last year), and weekly profit averaged **$1.9K** (vs **$1.5K** last year), reflecting consistent improvement in short-term performance. 
* **Regional Disparity:** **Germany led with $317K in sales (~12% margin)**, while **Italy lagged with $75K sales (~6.6% margin)**, highlighting uneven market penetration and profitability across geographies.
* * **Seasonality Peaks:** Sales peaked in **June ($91.9K)**, but this month also recorded the highest **losses ($8.9K)** due to underperforming machine sales.

### Product Performance
* **Category Leaders:** **Chairs and Phones** each generated **$148K**, together accounting for **31% of total sales**.  
* **Profit Drivers:** Nearly **49% of company profit** came from **Phones (20.5%)** and **Copiers (23.3%)**. Top products included **Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier ($13.4K profit)** and **Canon PC1060 Laser Copier ($3.2K profit)**.  
* **Loss-Making Subcategory:** Machines saw a **$14K YoY decline**, moving from **+$5K profit to –$9K loss**. The biggest loss contributors were **Lexmark MX611dhe Printer (–$8.1K)** and **Cubify Cubex 3D Printer (–$3.8K)**.

### Customer Analytics
* **Minimal Growth in Customer Base:** While **sales per customer grew by 27.3%** and **order count by 24.8% YoY**, total customer growth was just **0.5%**. Over the last 5 years, the customer base has expanded by only **30%**, indicating acquisition challenges.  
* **Order Distribution:** Average customer placed **5 orders/year**, with **70% of customers making orders in the range of 3–6 orders**. This suggests stable engagement among existing customers but limited expansion in new segments.
* **Pareto Concentration:** **42% of customers contributed 80% of total sales**. 

---

## Recommendations
* **Boost Customer Acquisition** – Launch referral programs, targeted marketing, and regional campaigns to address stagnation (<1% YoY growth).  
* **Optimize Product Portfolio** – Phase out or reprice unprofitable machine products (Lexmark MX611dhe, Cubify Cubex) while expanding profitable categories like Phones and Copiers.  
* **Replicate Regional Success** – Apply Germany’s high-margin sales strategy in weaker markets like Italy to balance performance.     
* **Weekly KPI Monitoring** – Use weekly trends to rapidly detect underperformance, enabling proactive interventions.
